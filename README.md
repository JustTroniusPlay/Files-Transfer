# Files Transfer
Small Project for downloading files from the web and redirecting them to disk space on your PC throught console. 


STILL WIP!!!!

# Overview, general idea and planned features.

Idea of this program is pretty simple: you can use it in console to download files from sources, that listed in one file, and load them to choosen catalogue. 


Program will take three inputs(separated by space):

1. Path to your file with links.
2. Path to catalogue.
3. Number of files that will be downloaded in parallel(MIN=1, MAX=999).

# Plans.

Right now this project still in development, but after some time this description will be supplemented with used libraries, links to them and guids to how properly
configure everything.
