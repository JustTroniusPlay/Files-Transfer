# Files Transfer
Small Project for downloading files from the web and redirecting them to disk space on your PC throught console. 

Work In Progress. This project essentially just programming training and not something really big or very serious.

## Overview, general idea and planned features.

Idea of this program is pretty simple: you can use it in console to download files from sources, that listed in one file, and load them to choosen catalogue. 


Program will take three inputs(separated by space):

1. Path to your file with links.
2. Path to catalogue.
3. Number of files that will be downloaded in parallel(MIN=1, MAX=999).

## Installation

This program still in development. Full installation guide will be available later.
